        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
          My audience is anyone from 13-75, due to the fact that anyone younger
          would not be able to understand the information provided on the site.
          My site will provide those who reside in Idaho the weather conditions
          of every city and neighborhood, from the capital to the neighborhoods,
          helping them prepare for the days ahead. With Idaho Weather, they can
          answer questions such as:
          <li>Is tomorrow going to be rainy or sunny?</li>
          <li>Should I wear pants or shorts?</li>
          <li>Are the roads safe to travel on during the winter?</li>
          <li>Should I remain indoors our enjoy the beauties of nature?</li>
          <li>What is the forecast going to be for the next week?</li>
        </p>
